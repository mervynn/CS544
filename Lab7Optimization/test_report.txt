a). @LazyCollection(value = LazyCollectionOption.EXTRA) -> 15931

b). @BatchSize:

(size = 10) -> 14775; (size = 10) -> 16603; (size = 50) -> 12912

c). @Fetch(value = FetchMode.SUBSELECT) -> 9494

d). join fetch -> 10743

e). EntityGraph -> 13255

Based on above test result: SUBSELECT is best.

While there's a wired thing:
In the debug model of using sub select strategy, it's just stuck there.
Not went through all the time.
